CHANGES IN GeoLight VERSION 1.03

OVERVIEW 

   o We thank Eli Brigde, Michael Sumner and Eldar Rakhimberdiev for fruitful comments during a workshop.
   o Version 1.03 provides one new filter function and some additional graphical output
   o With the help of the users we could remove some bugs and improve the package significantly
   
 NEW FUNCTIONS

   	o loessFilter
	Filter to remove outliers based on residuals from a local
	polynomial regression fitting process (loess). 


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	o   twilightCalc
	A new argument was added to the twilightCalc function: preSelection.
	If preSelection=TRUE a routine will go trough all times where the light
	intensity crosses the light threshold. Only the earliest in the morning
	and the latest in the evening will be set as "choosen" for further
	graphical examination. This usually results in a much faster interactive
	process especially if the light intensity fluctuates much around the 
	light threshold.	
	
	
	o   getElevation
	In addition to the already existing graph where the user gets an
	overview of all defined twilight times within the calibration period
	as well as the deviation from the optimal sun elevation, another plot shows
	the sun elevaion curves for the calibration period at the known position
	and the defined twilight events. The two graphs are highly redundant but
	we think that the new graph gives a better impression about the distribution
	of the defined twilight events and whether single twilight events should
	be excluded from the calibration period (i.e. twilight events which do not
	represent the sunrise or sunset).


CHANGES IN GeoLight VERSION 1.02


OVERVIEW 

   o We thank all users providing helpful comments and helping to identify bugs
   o Some modifications to internal code.
  
NEW FUNCTIONS

   	o lightFilter
	Filter to remove noise in light intensity measurements during the night



CHANGES IN GeoLight VERSION 1.01


OVERVIEW 

   o We thank Eli Brigde for helpful comments.
   o We thank Michael U. Kemp (Author from the RNCEP Package) to help us writing a code for exporting a trip into Google Earth
   o James Fox provided details to write a transformation script for geolocator data from Migrate Technology Ltd.
   o Some modifications to internal code.
  
NEW FUNCTIONS

   	o luxTrans
	Files with the siuffix .lux are derived from geolocators provided by Migrate Technology Ltd. 
	luxTrans() produces a table with datetime and light recordings in a format 
	required by GeoLight.
	   	
	o trip2kml
	This function creates a .kml file from light intensity measurements over time that can ve viewed as a trip in Google Earth


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

	o   twilightCalc
	Code to calculate the times were light recordings pass the light intensity threshold
	were modified. Therewith wrong calculations from the first versions should not appear
	anymore. The new code is also faster. Most important, the way how users can judge
	the calculated twilight events has changed significantly. The function provides a
	very similar plot (with some more details about the date and the time of the twilight events),
	however wrong definitions can be deleted by clicking the first mouse buttom at the 
	particular twiligth event (and vice verca). Clicking the second mouse bottom will move the
	time series forwards (no backward moving is possible).

	o   changeLight
	The function got an additional argument: quantile! If this argument is specified e.g. 0.6, only
	change points with higher probabilities than 60% of all calculated probabilites will be 
	considered as changes in the movement behavior. The arguments rise.prob and set.prob will not be
	considered if quantile is defined by a value.
